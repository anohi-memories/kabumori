# Claude Task 3

- task_id: x-social-mobile-e3-delete-revoke-residue-20261001
- owner: claude
- slot: claude-3
- status: ready
- next_owner: claude
- priority: critical
- recommended_model: Opus5.5（高）
- continues_from: x-social-mobile-pr63-merge-native-e3-resume-20260930
- purpose: E3の使い捨てユーザー/X接続が正常に成立した状態から、アカウント削除E2Eを最後まで検証する。削除によるX認可失効、Vault/DB/Auth等の残存データ、既存本番アカウントへの非影響を確認する。

## Confirmed starting point

Operator report:
- local iPhone Simulator build is connected to real production data.
- a genuinely disposable X account `@tigers_torataro` is now connected successfully to the disposable social-mobile user.
- protected production posting accounts were not touched.
- account deletion and X authorization revoke have NOT been executed yet.
- a temporary local-only browser-session workaround was used to choose the correct X account; it was not committed.

The previous K3 blocker (wrong X account already connected in production) is therefore resolved.

## Mandatory startup

1. Read `.agent/ORCHESTRATION.md`, `.agent/CURRENT_STATE.md`, this TASK, and the previous G3 report history.
2. Use the existing independent G3 worktree/checkout only. Do not use G4's worktree.
3. Fresh-check `origin/main`, but do NOT pull unrelated G4 source changes into the already verified E3 session unless rebuilding becomes unavoidable.
4. Do not make source changes in this task unless a blocking defect is found. This task is operational E2E verification.
5. Confirm the disposable connected X identity is exactly `@tigers_torataro`.
6. Confirm protected production posting accounts remain unchanged and are excluded from every destructive selector.
7. Do not reveal token plaintext, secret values, Vault plaintext, or personal email addresses in logs/report.

## Phase 1 — read-only preflight before deletion

Capture a read-only baseline sufficient to prove isolation:
- disposable Auth/user/profile/workspace/membership state
- disposable social account state and platform identity
- disposable token-reference / Vault-reference existence only (never plaintext)
- OAuth state / pending rows relevant to the disposable flow
- deletion/audit/tombstone baseline if present
- protected production X account state/count/hash or equivalent invariant
- Vault count/identifier hash or equivalent protected-account invariant
- feature flags relevant to deletion remain unchanged; do not globally enable deletion

Confirm again:
- no real X post
- no scheduler/manual publish
- no provider-console mutation
- no protected production account mutation

## MANDATORY STOP — fresh destructive approval

After Phase 1 is complete and BEFORE the first destructive action, STOP and report:

- disposable identity confirmed: `@tigers_torataro`
- read-only baseline captured
- protected production accounts unchanged
- exact first destructive operation: execute the existing account-deletion flow for this disposable social-mobile user
- expected effects: delete the disposable account/workspace data, revoke only this disposable X authorization as designed, remove only this disposable credential material
- feature remains OFF globally

Then request **fresh explicit user approval in the conversation**.

The user's current request to create this TASK is NOT the destructive approval.
Do not reuse any older approval.

## Phase 2 — after fresh approval only: execute deletion

Only after explicit approval:
1. Use the existing app/account-deletion E2E path for the disposable user.
2. If a local-only flag/config is required to expose the deletion path, keep it local/uncommitted and do not globally enable production deletion.
3. Perform the deletion once. Do not retry blindly if the result is ambiguous.
4. Do not manually revoke other X accounts or make provider-console changes.
5. If deletion fails before completion, STOP and preserve evidence; do not run separate cleanup mutations unless explicitly approved.

## Phase 3 — verify X revoke

After successful deletion:
- verify the deletion path attempted/completed revoke for the disposable X authorization according to the existing implementation.
- prefer server-side/audit/result evidence that does not require retaining token plaintext.
- if provider-side confirmation requires an interactive X "Connected apps" check, ask the user to perform only that read/confirmation for `@tigers_torataro`.
- never revoke the app globally and never touch the protected production X accounts.
- do not perform a real X post as a revocation test.
- if automatic revoke is not provable or failed, STOP; do not perform a separate manual revoke without new explicit approval.

## Phase 4 — residue / isolation verification

Read-only verify the disposable user's data is removed or intentionally retained exactly as designed. Check the relevant boundaries:
- Auth user/session
- profile/workspace/membership
- social account
- OAuth transient state
- token-reference/Vault credential
- content/settings/history rows owned only by the disposable workspace, where applicable
- deletion audit/tombstone records that are intentionally retained

Also prove protected production invariants are unchanged:
- existing production X accounts
- their credential references/Vault identifiers
- refresh state
- posting/scheduler state
- feature flags
- no real X post created

Classify every remaining row/value as:
- expected retained audit/tombstone
- unexpected residue
- unrelated protected production data

Do not "clean up" unexpected residue during verification. Report it first.

## Completion / K3

Report:
- task_id
- result
- destructive approval timestamp/message boundary
- deletion result
- X revoke proof/result
- residue matrix
- protected-account invariants before/after
- source changes (expected none)
- local-only temporary config used, if any
- tests/checks
- production mutations performed exactly
- real X posts = 0
- remaining issues
- safety checks
- next recommendation

Then status -> review_required, next_owner -> chatgpt, STOP for K3.

## Previous G3 task closure

Previous task `x-social-mobile-pr63-merge-native-e3-resume-20260930` reached Final K3 BLOCKED only because the first X identity was already connected to a protected production posting account. No destructive action occurred. Its report and Final K3 state remain in Git history / CURRENT_STATE and are not to be re-executed.
