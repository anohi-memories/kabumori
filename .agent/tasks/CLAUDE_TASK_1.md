# Claude Task 1

- owner: claude
- slot: claude-1
- status: ready
- next_owner: claude
- priority: high
- recommended_model: Sonnet5（高）
- purpose: PR #48でmerge済みの「今日のトピック」RPCをproductionへ安全に反映する前提を整える。まずmain上のmigration version衝突を解消し、内容が独立レビュー済みSQLと完全一致することを証明してPR化する。production applyはこのPhaseではまだ行わない。

## Context

Completed predecessor:
- task: `kabumori-daily-topic-level-settings-20260928`
- PR #48 reviewed head: `98732bf36b79190d52e6bca779fd19a7eb2b8a33`
- merged to main: `9ccbb59da2b6c48b0022ec2a31305a69262c2966`
- independent separate-Claude DB/RPC review: PASS
- P1/P2/P3 findings: none
- production migration apply: not yet performed

The reviewed migration SQL is:
- `supabase/migrations/20260928120000_add_daily_kabumori_tip_rpc.sql`

A new preflight issue was found after merge:
- `supabase/migrations/20260928120000_add_daily_kabumori_tip_rpc.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20260928120000_mic_scenario_layer_phase3a.sql`

share the same migration version prefix `20260928120000`.

This must be resolved before any production migration tooling is used.

## Mandatory startup / isolation

1. Use a new independent G1 worktree/checkout. Do not reuse the shared checkout or G2 worktree.
2. Fresh-fetch `origin/main`; record exact start SHA.
3. Read:
   - `PROJECT_RULES.md`
   - `.agent/ORCHESTRATION.md`
   - `.agent/CURRENT_STATE.md`
   - this TASK
   - both colliding migration files
4. Confirm no other slot is modifying either migration filename/content.
5. G2 currently owns `market-report-analysis` production observation. Do not touch its worktree, function, gates, cron, or settings.

## Phase A — migration-version collision fix only

### Required action

Rename ONLY the daily-topic migration to a fresh, unique, unused migration timestamp prefix.

Current:
`20260928120000_add_daily_kabumori_tip_rpc.sql`

Target:
- choose a new unused timestamp after checking fresh main's full `supabase/migrations` directory;
- keep the suffix `add_daily_kabumori_tip_rpc.sql`;
- do not rename or edit the MIC migration.

### Hard invariant: SQL bytes must not change

The SQL content of the daily-topic migration must remain byte-for-byte identical to the independently reviewed/merged SQL from PR #48.

Before and after rename:
- compute SHA-256 of file contents;
- hashes must match exactly;
- no whitespace/comment/content edits are allowed.

### Production preflight — read-only only

Before opening the rename PR, inspect production migration history / live function existence read-only.

Confirm:
- whether version `20260928120000` is present in production migration history;
- whether `public.get_daily_kabumori_tip(text,date)` already exists;
- whether the MIC Phase 3A objects/migration are already present.

If production state is ambiguous, if the shared version has already been recorded in a way that makes renaming unsafe, or if the daily-topic RPC is already live unexpectedly:
- STOP;
- do not repair migration history;
- do not apply/drop/recreate anything;
- report exact read-only findings for K1.

### Explicitly forbidden in Phase A

- no `supabase db push`
- no migration apply
- no migration-history repair
- no production DDL/DML
- no RPC create/drop/replace in production
- no Edge deploy
- no cron/settings/Auth/RLS/Vault/X changes
- no MIC migration/content changes
- no G2 changes

## Verification

Required:
- fresh-main migration filename uniqueness check after rename
- old path absent / new path present
- SQL SHA-256 before == after
- git diff must show rename-only for migration source
- `git diff --check`
- no source/app behavior changes
- production mutation = 0

Create a narrow PR for the rename only.

Do not self-merge.

## Completion / K1 gate

When Phase A is complete:
- status -> `review_required`
- next_owner -> `chatgpt`
- STOP for K1

ChatGPT will verify the rename-only PR and merge it if safe.

After that, a continuation task will authorize the exact production migration apply + ACL/readback/smoke checks.

No Codex review is expected for this rename-only phase.

## Required Report

Include:
- fresh main SHA
- independent worktree path / branch
- all colliding migration filenames found
- production read-only migration-history/function preflight
- old migration path
- new migration path
- SHA-256 before rename
- SHA-256 after rename
- proof hashes are identical
- exact diff summary
- tests/checks
- production mutation = 0
- PR number/head SHA
- remaining issues
- next recommendation
